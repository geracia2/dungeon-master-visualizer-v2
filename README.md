# Dungeon Master Visualizer v2

This is my third project for Per Scholas. This is a re-write of my original Dungeon Master Visualizer (DMV) to make it a full stack application as well as further define the user experience. The main challenge is to combine all knowledge gained in our course to produce a full stack application with user authentication/authorization, database manipulation and RESTful API requests through a React site.

**Deployment**

Back end, front end

###### The Problem

I was not happy with the user flow of my first DMV app and a re-write of the experience, implementing a backend, seemed like a reasonable challenge.

###### Planning

* I planned the UX initially with [hand sketches](https://github.com/geracia2/geracia2/blob/main/images/PXL_20240126_183533782.jpg?raw=true "link to sketches") then [wireframed](https://github.com/geracia2/geracia2/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202024-01-25%20230135.png?raw=true "link to screenshot of figma file") in [figma](https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FWG1Ntt6hG0IE12EUV1ZNB7%2FDMV-v2---wireframes%3Ftype%3Ddesign%26node-id%3D0%253A1%26mode%3Ddesign%26t%3DLXzkZsDmoK1Ir3fC-1 "link to figma file")
* I worked with tasks on a [Kanban board](https://nostalgic-football-46c.notion.site/c26674c6f1c44691a8be2ec163bf20e2?v=09c90ef5a0a74e4189eb1fec7c1b338a&pvs=4 "link to notion kanban") to keep track of my separation of concerns client/server.
* RESTful rout testing was done with [Postman](https://github.com/geracia2/geracia2/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202024-01-26%20132906.png?raw=true "screenshot of postman rout testing").
* I also needed to quickly establish an [Entity Relationship Diagram](https://github.com/geracia2/geracia2/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202024-01-26%20110434.png?raw=true "screenshot of ERD in figma") to best plan out Schema relationships especially when working with users in a reference relationship to scenes.
